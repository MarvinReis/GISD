# GISD Repository 2020
German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation (GISD)

This repository contains data of the The German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation (GISD). With GISD our aims were to develop a regional socioeconomic deprivation index for Germany that (1) can be used to analyse regional socioeconomic inequalities in health and (2) provides a basis for explaining regional health differences in Germany. 

Originally the GISD data archive was submitted to [GESIS Datorium](https://datorium.gesis.org/xmlui/handle/10.7802/1460). But as we plan to update GISD anually when new data from [www.inkar.de](http://www.inkar.de) is available, it will be hosted at github.

If you need help with GISD please feel free to contact [FG 28 of RKI](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Institut/OrgEinheiten/Abt2/FG28/fg28_node.html) or file an [Issue at GitHub](https://github.com/Skeiwalkski/GISD/issues).

For details see the [GISD Homepage](https://Skeiwalkski.github.io/GISD).

**Please note:**
*Currently, we do NOT advise to use the index Revision 2019 due to a limited comparability with the older revisions that we are investigating (with a currently limited capacity)*
